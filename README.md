# Masters_Code
Storage for code used during my masters project
Kia Ora this repository is just for storing the code used to construct and do post-analysis on the transcriptome I made as part of my master's project. 
If you have any questions about this feel free to contact me at my email address mcpka723@student.otago.ac.nz
